## What is monmi?

monmi is a powerful Next.js-based web app builder that combines **C**laude Code's (Cursor CLI also supported!) advanced AI agent capabilities with **Lovable**'s simple and intuitive app building experience. Just describe your app idea - "I want a task management app with dark mode" - and watch as monmi instantly generates the code and shows you a live preview of your working app. You can deploy your app to Vercel and integrate database with Supabase for free.

This open-source project empowers you to build and deploy professional web applications easily for **free**.

How to start? Simply login to Claude Code (or Cursor CLI), start monmi, and describe what you want to build. That's it. There is no additional subscription cost for app builder.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js 18+
- Claude Code or Cursor CLI (already logged in)
- Git

## Quick Start

Get monmi running on your local machine in minutes:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/opactorai/Claudable.git
cd Claudable

# Install all dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

Your application will be available at http://localhost:3000

**Note**: Ports are automatically detected. If the default port is in use, the next available port will be assigned.

## Troubleshooting
- **Database migration conflicts**: If you upgraded from a previous monmi version and run into database errors, reset the Prisma database so it matches the latest schema:
  ```bash
  npm run prisma:reset
  ```
  The command drops and recreates the local database, so back up any data you need before running it.

## Setup

The `npm install` command automatically handles the complete setup:

1. **Port Configuration**: Detects available ports and creates `.env` files
2. **Dependencies**: Installs all required Node.js packages
3. **Database Setup**: SQLite database auto-creates at `data/cc.db` on first run

### Desktop App (Electron)

Build and run monmi as a desktop application:

```bash
# Development mode
npm run dev:desktop

# Build desktop app
npm run build:desktop

# Package for specific platforms
npm run package:mac      # macOS
npm run package:win      # Windows
npm run package:linux    # Linux
```

### Additional Commands
```bash
npm run db:backup   # Create a backup of your SQLite database
                    # Use when: Before major changes or deployments
                    # Creates: data/backups/cc_backup_[timestamp].db

npm run db:reset    # Reset database to initial state
                    # Use when: Need fresh start or corrupted data
                    # Warning: This will delete all your data!

npm run clean       # Remove all dependencies
                    # Use when: Dependencies conflict or need fresh install
                    # Removes: node_modules/, package-lock.json
                    # After running: npm install to reinstall everything
```

## Usage

### Getting Started with Development

1. **Connect Claude Code**: Link your Claude Code CLI to enable AI assistance
2. **Describe Your Project**: Use natural language to describe what you want to build
3. **AI Generation**: Watch as the AI generates your project structure and code
4. **Live Preview**: See changes instantly with hot reload functionality
5. **Deploy**: Push to production with Vercel integration

### Database Operations

monmi uses SQLite for local development. The database automatically initializes on first run.

## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use

The application automatically finds available ports. Check the `.env` file to see which ports were assigned.

### Installation Failures

```bash
# Clean all dependencies and retry
npm run clean
npm install
```

### Claude Code Permission Issues (Windows/WSL)

If you encounter the error: `Error output dangerously skip permissions cannot be used which is root sudo privileges for security reasons`

**Solution:**
1. Do not run Claude Code with `sudo` or as root user
2. Ensure proper file ownership in WSL:
   ```bash
   # Check current user
   whoami
   
   # Change ownership of project directory to current user
   sudo chown -R $(whoami):$(whoami) ~/monmi
   ```
3. If using WSL, make sure you're running Claude Code from your user account, not root
4. Verify Claude Code installation permissions:
   ```bash
   # Reinstall Claude Code without sudo
   npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code --unsafe-perm=false
   ```
